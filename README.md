# Smarketer Tracking Suite Tracker

This folder hosts the Tracker Script for the Smarketer Tracking Suite (STS).

It supports different Tracking Services (Google Tag Manager) and Consent Managers (BeeClever, Shopify). Components can be easily added to enable the tracker to work more universally.

The Tracker Script gets most of its information from the Configuration-Snippet injected into the Storefront Theme by the theme extension.
